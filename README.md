# Toronto Airbnb Data Analysis

This project explores Airbnb listings in Toronto using Python.  
The goal is to understand pricing patterns and how listing titles might reflect value.

- Cleaned the raw Airbnb data and handled missing values
- Created visualizations:
  - Bar chart of average prices by room type
  - Interactive map showing average prices by neighbourhood
  - Scatter plot comparing listing title sentiment and price
- Built a simple linear regression model to check if sentiment affects pricing
